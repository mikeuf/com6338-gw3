            <p>
                SpongeBob is a childish, joyful, eccentric sea sponge who lives in a
                pineapple on 124 Conch Street with his pet snail Gary in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom. He works as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab, a job in which he is exceptionally skilled. He attends Mrs. Puff's Boating School, though has yet to receive a driver's license due to his inability to drive a boatmobile. SpongeBob lacks a lot of knowledge and is a constant annoyance to those around him, but he is very good-natured.

            <p>
            Mr. Krabs is a crimson red sea crab who lives in an anchor with his daughter Pearl. He is the owner and founder of the Krusty Krab as well as the employer of both SpongeBob SquarePants and Squidward Tentacles. Mr. Krabs is mostly respected by SpongeBob, who sees him as a father figure. He will do almost anything to obtain or preserve money, no matter how small the amount, usually with no regards to the safety or well-being of others or even himself.

            <h2>The Co-Worker</h2>
            
            <p>
            Squidward is a turquoise octopus who lives in a house shaped like an Easter Island head. He works as the cashier of the Krusty Krab, a job he absolutely loathes. However, he has a love for the clarinet. Squidward is a very selfish individual and displays an unjustified air of superiority.
